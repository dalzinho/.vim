# .vimrc

### Purpose
I've been mucking about Vim and I \*gasp\* think I quite like it.

But, it needs quite a lot of configuration, so I'm going to try to get a configuration I like saved and under version control so that I don't need to try and remember all this stuff :) !

### What's included?
* YouCompleteMe
	* offers autocomplete suggestions for text.
* auto-pairs
	* auto closes brackets, speech marks etc.
* ultisnips
	* autocomplete code snippets for e.g. psvm, sop.
* vim-commentary
	* Allows lines to be easily commented and uncommented

### Settings
* Line numbers shown
* tab spacing set to 2
* syntax colouring enabled 
* Monokai colour scheme used
